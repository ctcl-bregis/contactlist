## 0.1.0 - June 16, 2023 - "Careful, it's a prototype"

First release of ContactList, where it would be field-tested by being used on my servers for personal contact management. In the app's current state, it may be unstable and have unimplemented features.

This release was done from Fort Myers Beach, Florida, United States on a follow-up business trip.
